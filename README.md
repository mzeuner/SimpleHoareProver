# A simple implementation of Hoare logic in Agda
This is a very ad-hoc implementation of a Hoare triple prover,
following C.A.R. Hoare's classic paper "An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming".
Its original purpose is to serve as a demo ina reading course on "Classical Papers in Computer Science".
The original example from the paper can be found in `Example.agda`
